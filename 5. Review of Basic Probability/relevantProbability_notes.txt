##### Refresher on Relevant Probability #####

##### Sample Spaces #####

Sample Space S = All possible outcomes
(in algorithms, S is usually finite)

Each outcome i in S has a probability p(i) >= 0

Constraint:  SIGMA(i in S) p(i) = 1

##### Events #####

Event = a subset s <= S

The probability of an event s is SIGMA(i in s) p(i)

##### Random Variables #####

Random variable X is a real-valued function X: S -> R

##### Expectation #####

Let X: S -> R be a random variable.

The expectation E[X] = average value of X = SIGMA(i in S) X(i)*p(i)

##### Linearity of Expectation #####


Let X1, ..., Xn be random variables defined on S.

Then: E[SIGMA(j = 1, n) Xj] = SIGMA(j = 1, n) E[Xj]

Crucially:  Holds even when Xj's are not independent.  (Would be false if replace sums with products)

Proof: SIGMA(j = 1, n) E[Xj] = SIGMA(j = 1, n)SIGMA(i in S) Xj(i)*p(i)
                             = SIGMA(i in S)SIGMA(j = 1, n) Xj(i)*p(i)
			     = SIGMA(i in S) p(i) * (SIGMA(j = 1, n) Xj(i))
		             = E[SIGMA(j = 1, n) Xj(i)]

##### Conditional Probability #####

Let X, Y in S be events

Then P[X|Y] = P[intersection(X, Y)]/P[Y]

##### Independence (of events) #####

Definition: Events X, Y in S are independent if and only if P[intersection(X, Y)] = P[X]*P[Y]

This holds if and only if P[X|Y] = P[X], and P[Y|X] = P[Y]  (Consequence of independence)

Warning: Can be a very subtle concept.  Intuition is often incorrect.  Use the formal definition as much as possible.

Definition: Random variables A, B (both defined on S) are independent <=> the events P[A = a], P[B = b] are independent for all a, b.  (<=> P[A = a and B = b] = P[A = a]*P[B = b])

Claim: if A, B are independent, the E[A*B] = E[A]*E[B]
Proof: E[A*B] = SIGMA((a,b)) (a*b) * P[A = a and B = b]
       = SIGMA((a,b)) (a*b) * P[A = a] * P[B = b] (Since A and B are independent)
       = (SIGMA((a)) a * P[A = a]) * (SIGMA((b)) b * P[B = b])
              = E[A] * E[B]

##### General Formulas for Probabilities of Unions and Intersections of Events #####

P[union(A, B)] = P[A] + P[B] - P[intersection(A, B)]

P[intersection(A, B)] = P[A] * P[B|A]
